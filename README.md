**Motivation:**
Our motivation for creating XLearn stemmed from recognizing the common challenge of returning to traditional flashcard apps like Anki and Quizlet, which many find tiring and unengaging. Aware that people spend considerable time on social media, we saw an opportunity to make learning more accessible and engaging by integrating educational flashcards directly into users' daily social media feeds. This approach allows users to learn and review material effortlessly while engaging in their regular online activities, turning passive scrolling into a productive, educational experience.

**Solution:**
XLearn integrates flashcard learning into social media feeds, allowing users to engage with educational content effortlessly as they scroll. It utilizes X's API to automatically post memorization content through a bot, enhanced by Grok to make the bot responsive. Users can interact with the bot in natural language to receive personalized feedback. The platform supports both manual creation of flashcards and an import feature for generating flashcards from any URL's content, making it easy and convenient to tailor learning to individual needs and interests.
